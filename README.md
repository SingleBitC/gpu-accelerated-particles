# GPU Accelerated Particles

This is a particle system made up of 9.000.000 particles / 3000 px * 3000 px buffers; simulated and rendered entirely on GPU. This demo uses experimental WebGL features such as floating point textures and rendering to multiple frame buffers. May not work on most browsers. Firefox and a decent GPU should do fine. Tutorial will be available soon.

Live demo showcases 4.194.304 particles / 2048 px * 2048 px buffers:
